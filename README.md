# Acronis-Teknov8-AzureDR-EvalGuide-Draft01
This project repository aims to provide an evaluation guide for Disaster Recovery for Azure VMs using Acronis

## About this documentation

This documentation set will walk you through implementing a **DR Solution** for **Azure IaaS VMs** using **Acronis Cyber Clooud Disaster Recovery**  
https://www.acronis.com/en-gb/products/backup/disaster-recovery/

From your implemented DR scenario you will then be able to:

* Explore the management and operational aspects of DR using the Acronis Cyber protect console

## What is Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery?

**Effortless cloud-based Cyber Disaster Recovery for Acronis Cyber Protect**

Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery Add-on is built on top of Acronis Cyber Backup and ensures quick failover of your critical workloads to the cloud, improving your business continuity capabilities with ease. Gain instant data availability of all critical workloads no matter what kind of disaster strikes. 

**Disaster recovery (DR) on top of your backups** 
Add disaster recovery to your backups in a matter of seconds, utilizing the same agent, web console, backup storage, and cloud infrastructure. Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery Add-on, on top of Acronis Cyber Backup Cloud, provides all-in-one backup, disaster recovery, and advanced ransomware protection.

**Isolated testing environment** 
Ensure process availability with non-disruptive failover testing. Keep all backed up servers and applications running continuously and in line with your DR plan by starting recovery servers in Acronis Cloudâ€™s isolated testing environment, with no impact on your production network.

**Intuitive web-based console**
Set up, add, and configure the cloud-based recovery server with just a few clicks. The intuitive, touchfriendly, web-based console ensures IT generalists
can easily implement most disaster recovery activities, including network configuration, failover testing, and failback.

### What is a disaster recovery solution?
Disaster recovery solutions allow companies to quickly resume business-critical workloads after cyber-attacks, natural disasters or server failures. The disaster recovery process normally involves a separate physical or cloud site to restore data. Every disaster recovery solution aims to help businesses operate as usual. Since business continuity depends on high availability, disaster recovery strategies depend on RTOs and RPOs.

### Where should I back up my data to perform disaster recovery?
To be able to failover your critical workloads, you should back up your data to Acronis Cloud Storage.... As the disaster occurs, your workload will be failed-over to the //cloud// server running in the Acronis Cyber Disaster Recovery Storage.

### Can I backup data from Azure VMs
**Yes** you can protect your Azure IaaS VMs with this Acronis Disaster Recovery Solution; this will allow your VM to failover to the //cloud// instance running in the Acronis Cyber Cloud platform and can be failed-back when required; A S2S VPN will be required to provide connectivity between the two sites (Azure and Acronis Platforms) to enable protection.

## Evaluating in Azure

As with any infrastructure technology, in order to test, validate and evaluate the technology, there's typically a requirement for hardware and for this scenario this should ideally be hardware validated for Azure Stack HCI 21H2, found on our [Azure Stack HCI 21H2 Catalog](https://aka.ms/azurestackhcicatalog "Azure Stack HCI 21H2 Catalog") to perform a more real-world evaluation of Azure Stack HCI 21H2.

## Deployment Workflow

This guide will walk you through deploying a sandboxed infrastructure - the general flow will be as follows:

* **Part 1 - Deploy your Azure IaaS VM Host**: In this step, you'll create a VM in Azure using an Azure Resource Manager template. This VM will run Windows Server 2019 Datacenter, with the full desktop experience. PowerShell DSC will automatically configure this VM with the appropriate roles and features, download the necessary binaries, and configure 2 Azure Stack HCI 21H2 nodes, ready for clustering.

* **Part 2 - Configure your Azure Stack HCI 21H2 Cluster**: In this step, you'll use Windows Admin Center to deploy an Azure Stack HCI 21H2 cluster - along with a Cloud Witness, a Cluster Shared Volume, and finally, you'll register this cluster with Azure.

* **Part 3 - Integrate Azure Stack HCI 21H2 with Azure**: In this step, you'll use Windows Admin Center to register your Azure Stack HCI Cluster with Azure and explore what appears in the portal.

* **Part 4 - Explore the management and operation of your Azure Stack HCI 21H2 environment**: With your deployment completed, you're now ready to explore many of the management and operational aspects within the Windows Admin Center.

## Deployment Steps
This *next section* contains the steps you need to start implementing the DR solution.

*First thing though, this will require you to have the following things in place first:*

### Prerequisites
* For operational governance and control it is also **Strongly Recommended** to create a dedicated (*burner*) **Microsoft Tenant** for the purposes of this eval guide.
* This eval guide requires you to have access to an **Azure Subscription** with access to create a *Resource Group* and at least **Contributor** access on that Resource Group; it is recommended to have *Contributor* access at the **Subscription** scope level for simplicity *(Owner not required)*.
* You network connectivity shoud allow you access to reach the **Azure Portal** *https://portal.azure.com*, and allow you to open an **RDP Session** to your *ASHCI Host VM* running in Azure;
